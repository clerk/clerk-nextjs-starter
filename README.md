# Clerk - Next.js starter repository

This repository shows an example use case for how you can authenticate your users using [Clerk](https://www.clerk.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=nextjs_starter) as an authentication provider on your Next.js application.

## Running the starter

You have two option to run the starter, we recommend the one click deployment with Vercel. This way, environment variables are set up for you automatically and it's a much easier experience.

### Option 1 - One click deployment with Vercel

You can use the following deployment button from Vercel, [this article on our blog](https://clerk.dev/blog/clerk-vercel-one-click-deployment?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=nextjs_starter) guides you step to step on how to do so.
